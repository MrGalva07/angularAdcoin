    <h2>What are they for?</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies can be used for the same purposes as physical money itself. The three main functions are to serve as a medium of exchange, facilitating business transactions; store of value, for the preservation of purchasing power in the future; and also as a unit of account, when the products are priced and the economic calculation is carried out according to it.

    <h2>How to invest in cryptocurrencies</h2>
    <p>There are a few ways to invest in or acquire Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It is possible to buy shares of cryptocurrency funds, trade them directly on a specialized broker (also known as an exchange), accept the digital currencies as payment in a business or even mine.</p>
    <b></b>
    <p>Acquiring fund shares is one of the simplest ways. In 2018, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) allowed Brazilian funds to make indirect investments in cryptocurrencies abroad – buying derivatives or shares of other funds, for example.</p>

    <p>These portfolios are distributed by brokers and investment platforms and some require relatively low value investments (from R$ 5,000 or even less). Funds can be a good alternative for those who want to get exposure to the cryptocurrency market, but don't feel safe doing it alone, since the one who decides and monitors the applications is a specialized manager.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to invest in cryptocurrencies through ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), that is, an investment fund that is traded on the stock exchange like a stock.</p>

    <h2>How Price Variance Works</h2>
    <p>Basically, the price of digital currencies varies according to the good old law of supply and demand. In times when cryptocurrencies gain more attention, it is normal for them to be more sought after by investors, which increases the volume of purchases – and consequently, prices tend to rise.</p>
    <b></b>
    <p>"There are only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level to keep their price stable," the website Bitcoin.org explains.</p>
    <b></b>
    <p>As it is still a small market, few operations with cryptocurrencies are able to cause a relevant impact on prices. In a span of just three months in 2017, for example, the price of Bitcoin jumped from around $4,370 to $13,800. A little over a year later, it had already pulled back again to $3,500. The quotes, as it turns out, can be quite volatile.</p>
